MyjQuery - For educational purpose to understand vanilla javascript.
========

With the help of Frontendmasters.com, I created my own version of jQuery from scratch.


HTML doc using YUI3 can be found in
```javascript
./jsdoc/out
```

My rewrite can be found in <div class="header medium">
    <h1>Code coverage report for <span class="entity">All files</span></h1>
    <h2>
        
        Statements: <span class="metric">70.86% <small>(124 / 175)</small></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        
        
        Branches: <span class="metric">61.54% <small>(56 / 91)</small></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        
        
        Functions: <span class="metric">70.18% <small>(40 / 57)</small></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        
        
        Lines: <span class="metric">70.86% <small>(124 / 175)</small></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        
    </h2>
    <div class="path"></div>
</div>the below script file. I wrote most of the methods. Some were given to me during lecture.

```javascript
./my_jquery.js
```

Test cases are in mocha and chai. It was originally written in qunit but I found it ugly. So I used my favorite testing frameworks
```javascript
 ./my-jQuery-test.js
````

Using PhantomJS, I managed to get decent test coverage.

<div class="header medium">
    <h1>Code coverage report for <span class="entity">All files</span></h1>
    <h2>
        
        Statements: <span class="metric">70.86% <small>(124 / 175)</small></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        
        
        Branches: <span class="metric">61.54% <small>(56 / 91)</small></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        
        
        Functions: <span class="metric">70.18% <small>(40 / 57)</small></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        
        
        Lines: <span class="metric">70.86% <small>(124 / 175)</small></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        
    </h2>
    <div class="path"></div>
</div>
